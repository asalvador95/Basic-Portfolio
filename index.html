		<h1>About Me.</h1>
		<div class="border-line"></div>
		<p> Hey! I'm Adriana, but people call me Dee. I enjoy coding, designing different print works, and I even can do animations, 3D modeling, and video work. I work in Newark, NJ as a Graphic Designer. I design different work from catalogs to Amazon A+ Pages, and I can even do photo retouching! <br>
		I love to eat different kinds of foods! If I could I would travel the world and try as much foods as possible. I've traveled to Rome (Italy), Verona (Italy), Bedonia (Italy), Switzerland, Serbia, Portugal, and within the U.S. I went to Florida.</p>
